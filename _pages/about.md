I am a ** pharmacist and computational chemist** currently working as senior postdoctoral researcher at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, in the Kamerlin lab.

My research focuses on **enzyme catalysis, de novo biocatalyst design and drug discovery**, combining different computational tools such as  **QM/MM, enhanced sampling techniques, and machine-learning–based models** to uncover catalytic mechanisms and guide rational engineering.

I am particularly interested in **water-mediated catalytic networks**, **de novo enzyme design to improve thermal stability and selectivity**, and the development of **AI-driven workflows** for enzyme design and functional prediction.
