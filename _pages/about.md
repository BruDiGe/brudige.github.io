I am a **computational chemist and enzymologist** currently a postdoctoral researcher at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, working in the Kamerlin lab.

My research focuses on **enzyme catalysis, DNA polymerases, and biocatalyst design**, combining **QM/MM molecular dynamics, enhanced sampling techniques, and machine-learning–based models** to uncover catalytic mechanisms and guide rational engineering.

I am particularly interested in **water-mediated catalytic networks**, **polymerase fidelity and selectivity**, and the development of **AI-driven workflows** for enzyme design and functional prediction.
