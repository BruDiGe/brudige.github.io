abstract = {Abstract The mutation of remote positions on enzyme scaffolds and how these residue changes can affect enzyme catalysis is still far from being fully understood. One paradigmatic example is the group of lysosomal storage disorders, where the enzyme activity of a lysosomal enzyme is abolished or severely reduced. In this work, we analyze molecular dynamics simulation conformational ensembles to unveil the molecular features controlling the deleterious effects of the 43 reported missense mutations in the human lysosomal α-mannosidase. Using residue descriptors for protein dynamics, their coupling with the active site, and their impact on protein stability, we have assigned the contribution of each of the missense mutations into protein stability, protein dynamics, and their connectivity with the active site. We demonstrate here that the use of conformational ensembles is a powerful approach not only to better understand missense mutations at the molecular level but also to revisit the missense mutations reported in lysosomal storage disorders in order to aid the treatment of these diseases.},

abstract = {Residue interaction networks (RINs) provide graph-based representations of interaction networks within proteins, providing important insight into the factors driving protein structure, function, and stability relationships. There exists a wide range of tools with which to perform RIN analysis, taking into account different types of interactions, input (crystal structures, simulation trajectories, single proteins, or comparative analysis across proteins), as well as formats, including standalone software, web server, and a web application programming interface (API). In particular, the ability to perform comparative RIN analysis across protein families using “metaRINs” provides a valuable tool with which to dissect protein evolution. This, in turn, highlights hotspots to avoid (or target) for in vitro evolutionary studies, providing a powerful framework that can be exploited to engineer new proteins.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for the rapid development of antiviral therapies. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) are promising targets, and numerous virtual screenings for potential inhibitors were conducted without validation of the identified hits. Here we have tested a set of presumed RdRp inhibitors in biochemical assays based on fluorometric detection of RdRp activity or on the electrophoretic separation of RdRp products. We find that fluorometric detection of RdRp activity is unreliable as a screening method because many small compounds interfere with fluorophore binding to dsRNA, and this effect is enhanced by the Mg$^{2+}$ metal ions used by nucleic acid polymerases. The fact that fluorimetric detection of RdRp activity leads to false-positive hits underscores the requirement for independent validation methods. We also show that suramin, one of the proposed RdRp inhibitors that could be validated biochemically, is a multi-polymerase inhibitor. While this does not hinder its potential as an antiviral agent, it cannot be considered a specific inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.},

abstract = {The seventh pandemic of the diarrheal cholera disease, which began in 1960, is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium \textit{Vibrio cholerae}. Its environmental persistence provoking recurring sudden outbreaks is enabled by \textit{V. cholerae’s} rapid adaption to changing environments involving sensory proteins like ToxR and ToxS. Located at the inner membrane, ToxR and ToxS react to environmental stimuli like bile acid, thereby inducing survival strategies for example bile resistance and virulence regulation. The presented crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS in combination with multiple bile acid interaction studies, reveals that a bile binding pocket of ToxS is only properly folded upon binding to ToxR. Our data proposes an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. These findings support the previously suggested link between ToxRS and VtrAC-like co-component systems. Besides VtrAC, ToxRS is now the only experimentally determined structure within this recently defined superfamily, further emphasizing its significance. In-depth analysis of the ToxRS complex reveals its remarkable conservation across various \textit{Vibrio} species, underlining the significance of conserved residues in the ToxS barrel and the more diverse ToxR sensory domain. Unravelling the intricate mechanisms governing ToxRS’s environmental sensing capabilities, provides a promising tool for disruption of this vital interaction, ultimately inhibiting \textit{Vibrio’s} survival and virulence. Our findings hold far-reaching implications for all \textit{Vibrio} strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings.},

abstract = {Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway occurs frequently in a wide range of human cancers and is a main driver of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of cancer cells. Compounds targeting this pathway are under active development as anticancer therapeutics and some of them have reached advanced clinical trials or been approved by the FDA. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors combine multiple therapeutic efficacies in a single molecule by inhibiting the pathway both upstream and downstream of AKT. Herein, we report our efforts on the exploration of novel small molecule macrocycles (MCXs) as dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Macrocyclization is an attractive approach used in drug discovery, as the semi-rigid character of these structures could provide improved potency, selectivity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Importantly, this strategy allows access to new chemical space thus obtaining a better intellectual property position. A series of MCXs based on GSK-2126458, a known clinical PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is described. These molecules showed potent biochemical and cellular dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition, demonstrated strong antitumoral effects in human cancer cell lines, and displayed good drug-like properties. Among them, MCX 83 presented remarkable selectivity against a panel of 468 kinases, high in vitro metabolic stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic parameters without significant CYP450 and h-ERG binding inhibition. This profile qualified this compound as a suitable candidate for future in vivo PK-PD and efficacy studies in mouse cancer models.},
