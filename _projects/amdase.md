## Mechanistic Elucidation & Stereochemical Control in AMDase

Our work on **Arylmalonate Decarboxylase (AMDase)** focuses on understanding
the *alternative substrate binding modes* and how they affect product
stereochemistry. Using enzyme engineering, QM/MM modeling, and enhanced
sampling, we dissected the mechanistic origins of catalytic preference and
leveraged this insight to improve selectivity in non-native reactions.

### Highlights

- **Elucidated alternative binding modes** of alkenyl substrates in AMDase.
- **Integrated computation and experiment** to explain stereochemical outcomes.
- **Published in *Journal of the American Chemical Society***.
- **Graphical abstracts & interactive thumbnails** included below.
